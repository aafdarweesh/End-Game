##Game Details
This game I had started 2012, I did it in one month with no experience.
I wrote codes for every movement, for every touch, for everything it was a quite tiring but at the same time enjoyable moments.
I kept it in my mobile and always was thinking of the game that I wanted to build and I stopped because of Graphics and started school.

And today I will publish it after more than five years as I have to decided that Whenever I start something I will stop only when I finish it and for this game I will publish it at the moment with no change since the first time that I built

The game details :
You will have your own team and the opponent's time, each team has a number of members (your team members will be in the left side) that you can switch between them till that character disappear.
in the game there is four arenas (Space, Earth, Water, Crazy World)

Space Arena:
characters will move in straight line without any deflection in any direction

Earth Arena:
There will be gravity that will attract the characters down

Water Arena :
Will attract the characters up 

Crazy World Arena :
(The best one) each character will move in random path, your and the opponents characters 


I hope you enjoy playing the game!!!
it is lesson more than a game, that reminds you that whenever you start something keep working till you finish it even if it takes you years
